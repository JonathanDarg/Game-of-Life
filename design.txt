method public advanceTime()
V1)
    1. for every cell
        a. count its neighbors by going r-1 c-1, r-1 c, r-1 c+1, r c-1, r c+1, r+1 c-1, r+1 c, r+1 c+1
            1.if neighbor equals one add one to count
                i.if it has fewer than two
                    a.set cell to a zero
                ii.if it has two or three neighbors
                    a. set cell to one
                iii.if cell has more than three neighbours
                    a. set cell to 0
                iV. if dead cell has three neighbors
                    a. set cell to 1
V2)
    1.for every cell
        a. set count to zero
        b.if r-1 c-1, r-1 c, r-1 c+1, r c-1, r c+1, r+1 c-1, r+1 c, r+1 c+1 equal 1 and row and column are not out or bounds
            i. count ++
        c. if it is a live cell
            i. if count is greater than 2
                i. set it to zero
            ii. otherwise if count is equal to 2 or 3
                i. set it to one
            iii. otherwise set it to zero
        d. otherwise
            i. if count is equal to 3
                i. set it to one
            ii. set it to zero
        e. copy new board to board



Rules:
    1.Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies
    2.Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
    3.Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies
    4.Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell
